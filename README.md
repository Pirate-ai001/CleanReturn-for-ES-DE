# üéÆ CleanReturn

**CleanReturn** is a lightweight script system for managing Steam, Epic Games Store, and Non-Steam games in [ES-DE (EmulationStation Desktop Edition)](https://es-de.org/).  
It ensures a seamless controller-only loop: **ES-DE ‚Üí Game ‚Üí ES-DE** ‚Äî no lingering launchers or Alt+Tab required.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Download / Clone
Clone this repository or download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/releases) page.

### 2. Create Config
Copy `CleanReturn.config.example` into the **Scripts folder** (where `CleanReturn.ps1` is located).  
Rename it to `CleanReturn.config` and edit the paths for your system:

```ini
[SCRIPTS]
SCRIPTS_PATH=G:\ES-DE\Scripts\CleanReturn

[STEAM]
STEAM_EXE_PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe

[EPIC]
EPIC_SHORTCUTS_PATH=G:\ES-DE\Roms\Windows\Epic Shortcuts
```

## 3. Pick a Template

- **Steam Game (Template).bat** ‚Üí For most Steam games  
- **Steam Game Exception (Template).bat** ‚Üí If detection fails, requires `GameProcessName`  
- **Epic Games Store (Template).bat** ‚Üí Launches `.url` shortcuts, requires `GameProcessName`  
- **Non-Steam Game (Template).bat** ‚Üí Standalone `.exe`, requires `GAME_PATH` + `GameProcessName`

## 4. Edit Per-Game Values

Each template includes placeholders you must fill in:
| Variable              | Example Value                               | Required For                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `AppId`               | `1353230`, `EPIC_CONTROL`, `NONSTEAM_MYEXE` | All templates (Steam, Epic, Non-Steam)        |
| `GameProcessName`     | `Control_DX12.exe`                          | Required for Epic, Non-Steam, Steam Exception |
| `LauncherProcessName` | `steam`, `EpicGamesLauncher`, *blank*       | Optional, depends on launcher                 |
| `GAME_PATH`           | `C:\Games\Blur\Blur.exe`                    | Required for Non-Steam only                   |

## 5. Launch via ES-DE

Place the .bat files in your ES-DE Windows ROMs folder (e.g. G:\ES-DE\Roms\windows) and launch them directly from ES-DE.

## üîß Validation System (v1.0+)

Before launching, templates validate required values.

If something is missing or incorrect:

‚ùå The game will not launch

A clear error message will appear with step-by-step fix instructions
##
If everything is correct:

‚úÖ You‚Äôll see ‚ÄúValidation passed. Launching game‚Ä¶‚Äù

The game launches normally

This prevents silent failures and makes setup easier for new users.
