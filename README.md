# üéÆ CleanReturn-for-ES-DE

**CleanReturn** is a lightweight script system for managing Steam, Epic Games Store, and Non-Steam games in [ES-DE (EmulationStation Desktop Edition)](https://es-de.org/).  
It ensures a seamless controller-only loop: **ES-DE ‚Üí Game ‚Üí ES-DE** ‚Äî no lingering launchers or Alt+Tab required.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Download / Clone
Clone this repository or download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/releases) page.

### 2. Create Config
Copy `CleanReturn.config.example` into the **Scripts folder** (where `CleanReturn.ps1` is located).  
Rename it to `CleanReturn.config` and edit the paths for your system:

```ini
[SCRIPTS]
SCRIPTS_PATH=G:\ES-DE\Scripts\CleanReturn

[STEAM]
STEAM_EXE_PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe

[EPIC]
EPIC_SHORTCUTS_PATH=G:\ES-DE\Roms\Windows\Epic Shortcuts
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: CleanReturn.config must be placed in:
* ES-DE\Scripts\CleanReturn\CleanReturn.config 
  If the file is missing or in the wrong place, templates will fail with a clear error message:
  
> **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ERROR: CleanReturn.config not found.**
> Please ensure the config is copied and correctly named in the Scripts folder.

- The new templates are designed to be robust, but the config must be named `CleanReturn.config` and be present in the main **Scripts folder** next to `CleanReturn.ps1`.

## 3. Pick a Template

**Steam Game Template**

* Works for most Steam games.  
* Launches the game directly through Steam using its `AppId`.  
* CleanReturn monitors the running game process automatically ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to set `GameProcessName` unless detection fails.  
* After the game exits, if Steam was launched by ES-DE, it is closed automatically.  

Setup:  
1. Copy **Steam Game (Template).bat** from `/Templates` into your ES-DE `Roms\windows` folder.  
2. Rename it (e.g. `Blur.bat`).  
3. Edit the file and set the correct `AppId` (find this on the game‚Äôs SteamDB page or in Steam‚Äôs launch options).  

---

**Steam Game Exception Template**

* Use this when CleanReturn cannot automatically detect the game process (rare, but happens with some titles).  
* Works the same way as the default Steam template, but requires you to manually set `GameProcessName`.  
* `GameProcessName` must match the process name shown in Task Manager (no `.exe` extension needed).  

Setup:  
1. Copy **Steam Game Exception (Template).bat** from `/Templates` into your ES-DE `Roms\windows` folder.  
2. Rename it (e.g. `Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.bat`).  
3. Edit the file:  
   - Set `AppId` (Steam game ID).  
   - Set `GameProcessName` (from Task Manager ‚Üí Details tab).  

---  
# 

**Non-Steam Game Template**

* Launches a standalone `.exe` game with no launcher involved.  
* Requires both `GAME_PATH` (full path to the game‚Äôs executable) and `GameProcessName` (so CleanReturn can monitor and detect when the game closes).  
* No launcher cleanup is performed, since the game runs directly.  

Setup:  
1. Copy **Non-Steam Game (Template).bat** from `/Templates` into your ES-DE `Roms\windows` folder.  
2. Rename it (e.g. `Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.bat`).  
3. Edit the file and set:  
   - `AppId` (give it a unique identifier, e.g. `NONSTEAM_THAW`).  
   - `GAME_PATH` (full path to the game‚Äôs `.exe`, e.g. `G:\PC Games\THAW\Game\reTHAWed.exe`).  
   - `GameProcessName` (the process name from Task Manager, e.g. `reTHAWed.exe`).  
4. Launch from ES-DE ‚Äî CleanReturn will start the game, monitor the process, and return you cleanly back to ES-DE after exit.  

# 
- **Epic Games Store (Template).bat** ‚Üí Launches `.url` shortcuts, requires `GameProcessName`

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Epic Games setup note**  
Epic does not allow games to be launched directly by .exe.  
Instead, you must create a shortcut for each game from the Epic Launcher:  
- In Epic, right-click the game ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Create Desktop Shortcut.  
- Move the shortcut (.url file) into the folder you set as `EPIC_SHORTCUTS_PATH` in CleanReturn.config.  
  - Example: if your config has `EPIC_SHORTCUTS_PATH=G:\ES-DE\Roms\Windows\Epic Shortcuts`  
    then place the shortcut (e.g. `Control.url`) into that folder.  
- Copy the **Epic Games Store (Template).bat** from `/Templates` into your ES-DE `Roms\windows` folder.  
- Rename it (e.g. `Control.bat`) and edit the `AppId` and `GameProcessName` values inside.  
## 


## 4. Edit Per-Game Values

Each template includes placeholders you must fill in:
| Variable              | Example Value                               | Required For                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `AppId`               | `1353230`, `EPIC_CONTROL`, `NONSTEAM_MYEXE` | All templates (Steam, Epic, Non-Steam)        |
| `GameProcessName`     | `Control_DX12.exe`                          | Required for Epic, Non-Steam, Steam Exception |
| `LauncherProcessName` | `steam`, `EpicGamesLauncher`, *blank*       | Optional, depends on launcher                 |
| `GAME_PATH`           | `C:\Games\Blur\Blur.exe`                    | Required for Non-Steam only                   |

## 5. Launch via ES-DE

Place the .bat files in your ES-DE Windows ROMs folder (e.g. G:\ES-DE\Roms\windows) and launch them directly from ES-DE.

## üîß Validation System (v1.0+)

Before launching, templates validate required values.

If something is missing or incorrect:

‚ùå The game will not launch

A clear error message will appear with step-by-step fix instructions
##
If everything is correct:

‚úÖ You‚Äôll see ‚ÄúValidation passed. Launching game‚Ä¶‚Äù

The game launches normally

This prevents silent failures and makes setup easier for new users.
##

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

FINDSTR: Cannot open CleanReturn.config
‚Üí You forgot to copy CleanReturn.config.example to CleanReturn.config.

Game doesn‚Äôt close properly
‚Üí Check that GameProcessName matches Task Manager‚Äôs process name exactly.

Launcher stays open
‚Üí Ensure the flag file path in your template matches CleanReturn.config.

Scripts won‚Äôt run
‚Üí Run PowerShell as Admin and set execution policy:
```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned```
