## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes: CleanReturn

This document explains the inner workings of the `CleanReturn.ps1` script and templates.  
Most users won‚Äôt need this ‚Äî the README.md Quick Start is enough.

## 1. Config System

### Location
- `CleanReturn.config` must be in the **Scripts folder** (same location as `CleanReturn.ps1`).  
- Copy it from `CleanReturn.config.example`, rename, and edit paths once.  

### Example
```ini
[SCRIPTS]
SCRIPTS_PATH=G:\ES-DE\Scripts\CleanReturn

[STEAM]
STEAM_EXE_PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe

[EPIC]
EPIC_SHORTCUTS_PATH=G:\ES-DE\Roms\Windows\Epic Shortcuts
```

Edit this file once for your system.

*All templates automatically load these values.

*Only game-specific values remain inside each .bat.


## 2. Placeholders (Per-Game Values)

Each template still requires per-game info:
| Variable              | Example Value                         | Required For                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `AppId`               | `1353230`, `EPIC_CONTROL`             | All templates (Steam, Epic, Non-Steam)        |
| `GameProcessName`     | `Control_DX12.exe`                    | Required for Epic, Non-Steam, Steam Exception |
| `LauncherProcessName` | `steam`, `EpicGamesLauncher`, *blank* | Optional, depends on launcher                 |
| `GAME_PATH`           | `C:\Games\Blur\Blur.exe`              | Required for Non-Steam only

## 3. Validation System (v1.0+)

All templates now validate required values before launching.

If something is missing or invalid:

‚ùå Game does not launch.

A clear error message appears with instructions.

If everything is correct:

‚úÖ Displays ‚ÄúValidation passed. Launching game‚Ä¶‚Äù

Game runs normally.

This prevents silent failures and ensures smoother setup.

## 4. Template Breakdowns

Epic Games Store (Template)

*Launches game via .url shortcut in %EPIC_SHORTCUTS_PATH%.

*Validates AppId, GameProcessName, and shortcut existence.

*Cleans up EpicGamesLauncher.exe

---
---
Steam Game (Template)


*Recommended for most Steam games.

*Requires only AppId.

*Creates/uses KILL_STEAM_FLAG.tmp to decide whether Steam is closed after exit.

---
---

Steam Game Exception (Template)

*Use if detection fails.

*Requires both AppId and GameProcessName.

*Same Steam flag system as default template.
---
---

Non-Steam Game (Template)

*Launches standalone .exe.

*Requires GAME_PATH, AppId, and GameProcessName.

## 5. Flow of Execution

Here‚Äôs how CleanReturn works from launch to cleanup:

[ES-DE]
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Launch .bat template
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Loads CleanReturn.config (global paths)
‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Sets per-game values (AppId, GameProcessName, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Runs validation
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ If validation fails ‚Üí show error, stop
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ If validation passes ‚Üí echo success, continue
‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Launches game (via Steam/Epic/EXE)
‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Runs CleanReturn.ps1
‚îú‚îÄ Detects game process
‚îú‚îÄ Monitors until process closes
‚îî‚îÄ Performs cleanup
‚îú‚îÄ Close Steam (if flag present)
‚îú‚îÄ Close EpicGamesLauncher
‚îî‚îÄ Return to ES-DE
#
## 6. Finding the Game Process Name

Required for:

Epic Games

*Non-Steam games

*Steam exceptions

Steps:

*Launch the game.

*Open Task Manager ‚Üí Details tab.

*Find the .exe process.

*Use the exact name (with .exe).

Example: BombRushCyberfunk-Win64-Shipping.exe
#

## 7. Why Epic Cloud Saves Must Be Disabled

Epic Cloud Saves can create sync popups when a game is closed outside the Epic UI.
Disabling this ensures CleanReturn can exit the Epic launcher silently without interruption.

***

## 8. Troubleshooting

Game doesn‚Äôt close properly ‚Üí Check GameProcessName matches the process in Task Manager.

Launcher stays open ‚Üí Verify flag file path in the .bat matches CleanReturn.config.

FINDSTR: Cannot open CleanReturn.config ‚Üí You didn‚Äôt copy CleanReturn.config.example into the Scripts folder and rename it.

Script won‚Äôt run ‚Üí Run PowerShell as Admin:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
#

## 9. Security Notes

Batch files call PowerShell with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass.
This only affects the local, trusted CleanReturn.ps1.
No remote code is executed.




### üîê Advanced: Self-Signing for Stricter Policies

For users who prefer **not** to rely on `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, you can sign `CleanReturn.ps1` with a self-signed certificate:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.  
2. Create a self-signed certificate:  

   ```powershell
   New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type CodeSigningCert -Subject "CN=CleanReturn"
   ```

3. Sign the script:
Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath "CleanReturn.ps1" -Certificate (Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My -CodeSigningCert)[0]

4. Change your execution policy to only allow signed scripts: Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
This way, PowerShell will only run scripts you have explicitly signed, adding another layer of trust.

### 10. Future Improvements / Roadmap

Planned/potential enhancements:

Additional launcher support (GOG, Ubisoft Connect, Xbox PC Game Pass).

Optional logging of launches, exits, and cleanup results.

Enhanced security (signed scripts, configurable execution modes).

Cross-platform considerations (Linux + Proton/Wine).
